#Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­
#drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
#is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
    # complexity O(n^2)
